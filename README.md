# SwiftQuiz

A package that helps with handling Quizzes, their responses, and the navigation between questions.


## Getting Started

See the QuizView preview for an example on how to get started.


## Styling

Styling the quiz is quite simple. Just override the `quizStyle` environment variable. There are several things you can change, like the primary color (used for the button and the selected icon color), border radius, border color, and the animation that happens when you select a field.


## Contributing

Feel free to contribute. I made this for me, since I've needed something like this several times now. The first thing that could use help are better docs (in code and in the readme). Then, I'd like to add Transitions to the Style struct, but since they are an iOS 17+ thing it's a bit different trying to support both 16 and 17+
